# Introduction

I work for the company Autremer Gourmet, which is a company in which we produce different ranges of products made of fish (potted meat, patilottes, ...)
I think to put pictures later on to this file.

My work as an apprentice is to develop an inventory management software taking into account the basic products but also semi-finished products such as sauces, but also the finished products (potted meat, ...)

It is a very good and big project

# Begin

I begin the visual part in order to give an overview of the application to the loan of my chief.

# Development

The software will be connected later with several labellers, here is the device:
